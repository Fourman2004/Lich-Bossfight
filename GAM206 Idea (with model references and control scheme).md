# Boss Idea
The Idea for My Boss fight comes from a personal Project. The game is a first person shooter that utilizes movement similar to Get to the Orange door and Titanfall 2 or Ultrakill.
One Boss, Later Enemy, is the Lich. The lich is a dark reflection of the main character, who knows the old ways and shadow-based magic.
The Boss will be RNG BAsed, in either stealthily Moving, launching a projectile at the player, summoning 3 Minions to assist them, and immolating the player.
The minions will alternate between a regular melee attack, and the flame attack the lich does. On death, they will drop health pickups botht he lich and the player can use to regain health.
